## Project Overview
Urban mobility analysis is crucial for understanding how people move within a city. This project leverages machine learning algorithms (k-means clustering) to analyze mobility data and generate clusters representing areas with similar patterns of movement. The results can help urban planners and policymakers improve transportation systems, reduce congestion, and optimize urban design.

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes urban mobility data, which consists of geographic coordinates and timestamps. The data is preprocessed to remove noise and anomalies, making it suitable for clustering analysis.

### Features
- **Geographical coordinates**: Latitude and longitude values representing locations.
- **Timestamp**: Date and time information for movement data points.

## Results
- **Clustering Algorithm**: The project uses KMeans clustering to group similar areas based on mobility patterns.
- **Visualization**: A Folium map is used to visualize the clustered regions on a map for easy interpretation.
Results
The clusters generated by the machine learning model highlight areas with high mobility similarity. These insights can be used for:

- Optimizing public transport routes
- Identifying high-traffic areas for infrastructure improvement
- Enhancing urban design and reducing traffic congestion
